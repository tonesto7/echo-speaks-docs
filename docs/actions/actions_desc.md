## <h2>Echo Speaks Actions:</h2>

This new child app will allow you to create rules based on device, location, schedule trigger events while defining conditions to utilize the full features of the Echo Speaks devices Without requiring a 3rd party app like WebCore..

The idea behind Actions was to create a simple but powerful app to trigger speech/announcements or other Echo Speaks features.
The beauty is in the flexibility of each action, it can be as simple as a single speech event when the front door is unlocked.
To as complex as selecting multiple triggers (contacts, motion, presence, etc.) and defining criteria and custom responses for each individual event type.
